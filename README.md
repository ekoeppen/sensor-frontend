# Sensor Frontend

A React based web frontend for environmental data

This web frontent uses data stored in two DynamoDB tables (sensor config and sensor data)
to show environmental data from temperature and temperature/humidity sensors. It uses
[Grommet](http://grommet.io/) components for the user interface, and Redux for state
management.
